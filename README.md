# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) - Edge Removal and Reconnection Algorithm

###  Project Objective:
This project demonstrates an algorithm that removes an edge from a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and substitutes it with another edge, ensuring the tree structure is preserved. The approach utilizes key properties of MSTs from graph theory.
